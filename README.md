# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository  

This repository contains my **implementations and solutions** for various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts in **JavaScript**. It serves as a learning resource and reference for improving problem-solving skills, **competitive programming**, and **technical interview preparation**.  

## 🚀 What’s Inside?  
### 🔹 Data Structures  
- Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues  
- Hash Tables, Heaps (MinHeap, MaxHeap)  
- Trees (BST, AVL, Trie)  
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix)  

### 🔹 Algorithms  
- Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort)  
- Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)  
- Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS)  
- Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s)  
- Recursion & Dynamic Programming  

### 🔹 Practice Problems  
- Hand-picked **LeetCode, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks** problems  
- Solutions with **explanations & complexity analysis**  
- Optimized **code following best practices**
