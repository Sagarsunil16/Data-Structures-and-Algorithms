# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository  

This repository contains my **JavaScript implementations** of various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It serves as a reference for improving problem-solving skills, **competitive programming**, and **technical interview preparation**.  

## 🚀 What’s Inside?  
### 🔹 Data Structures (Implemented in JavaScript)  
- **Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues**  
- **Hash Tables, Heaps (MinHeap, MaxHeap)**  
- **Trees (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Trie)**  
- **Graphs (Adjacency List, Adjacency Matrix, Weighted Graphs)**  

### 🔹 Algorithms (Implemented in JavaScript)  
- **Sorting**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort  
- **Searching**: Binary Search, Linear Search  
- **Graph Algorithms**: DFS, BFS, Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s  
- **Recursion & Dynamic Programming**  

### 🔹 Practice Problems  
- Hand-picked **LeetCode, Codeforces, and GeeksforGeeks** problems  
- Solutions with **explanations & complexity analysis**  
- Optimized **JavaScript code following best practices**
