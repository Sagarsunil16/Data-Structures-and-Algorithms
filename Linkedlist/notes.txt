1.1 What is a Linked List?
A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node via a next pointer.

Advantages over Arrays:
    Dynamic size (no pre-allocation).
    O(1) insertion/deletion at head (vs O(n) for arrays).

Disadvantages:

    No random access (O(n) search time).
    Extra memory for pointers.


1.2 Types of Linked Lists
    Singly Linked List
    Doubly Linked List
    Circular Linked List

2. Core Operations

3. Key Patterns
    3.1 Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise & Hare)
    3.2 Reversing a Linked List

4. Problem Solving
    Problem 1: Reverse Linked List (LeetCode 206)
    Problem 2: Detect Cycle (LeetCode 141)
    Problem 3: Merge Two Sorted Lists (LeetCode 21)
    Problem 4: Remove Nth Node From End (LeetCode 19)
